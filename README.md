- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tejaswini200 from Bangalore. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Automation Testing and Manual Testing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new libraries and tools used to build a framework.


Project Title: Web Automation of Selenium Easy Website
Built a framework to automate a website (Selenium https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/) using TestNG, Maven, Page Object Model, Lombok, email manager, Extent Reports.

Thread.sleep() can be used to pause the execution of current thread for specified time in miliseconds.
scrollToElement() can be used to scroll to the specified element in browser
setUpBrowserDriver() can be used to perform Cross browser testing 
handlePopUp() can be used to close the pop-up window
navigateToFormPage() can be used in switch statements to check for corresponding values
getScreenshot() can be used to get a screenshot of the failed Test Cases
TestNG Listener can be used to generate logs or customize the testNG reports
framework.property file will consist of various paths which can be accessed by getProperty()
